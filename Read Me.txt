This is the Read Me for client implementation of gRPC. Before implementing this, first follow the server implementation of gRPC.

1.First step is to copy the files hello_world_pb2.py and helloworld_pb2_grpc.py from server and replace them in client

2. (Optional, Already generated) Now get an API key from the Console's API Manager for use in the client later.
	-> From Google Cloud Dashboard -> APIs & Services -> Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Api Key

3.Now, to locally run the gRPC Client and see the connection with server is working fine or not.
-> python greeter_client.py --host=<IP of GKE LoadBalancer>:80 --api_key=<API Key from Console>
You can directly use 
-> python greeter_client.py --host=104.199.152.176:80 --api_key=AIzaSyCWGpNzPKcPi6KIW0jOPYUeE0PUDuWJpT0

4. To run the client pod, 
	a. First, build the docker container-
	-> gcloud builds submit --tag asia.gcr.io/kubernetes-practice-290405/hello-client-grpc:latest .
	
	b. To create the deployment, run-
	-> kubectl create -f ./deployment.yaml
	
	c. To check the logs and the code is running fine, run-
	-> kubectl logs -l app=hello-client
